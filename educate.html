	<p>
		Quantum physicist Shohini Ghose's presentation at TEDWomen 2018 shows
		the vast potential and amazing power quantum computing holds. Dr. Ghose
		first gives the live audience a better understanding of the difference
		between conventional and quantum computing by showing how they've
		already interacted with such a machine prior to the presentation. Unlike
		the binary "1's and 0's" nature of the layman's PC, a quantum computer
		is capable of calculations on a spectrum. There is no "either/or" in
		nature, and the quantum mechanics underlying the machine help it to
		understand that.
	</p>
	<p>
		Quantum computing isn't just a fancy technology that can beat people at
		games of chance, though. Dr. Ghose goes on to show just how revolutionary
		it is by comparing binary machines to candles and quantum machines to
		light bulbs. This metaphor illustrates what a revolutionary bound
		quantum computers would be if they were integrated into everyday society.
		Ghose lists some of the advantages mankind could draw as follows:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Extremely sophisticated encryption through uncertainty principles</li>
			<li>Advances in healthcare and medicine via molecule analysis</li>
			<li>Teleportation of information without physical transmission (no, seriously!)</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		This all may sound like something out of a science fiction novel, but
		Dr. Ghose assures us that not only are these very real possibilities, some
		have even been demonstrated in controlled environments already. We are
		essentially on the brink of transforming society for the better through
		this new technology. Dr. Ghose perhaps puts it best: <q>I don't see quantum 
		physics as a tool just to build quantum computers. I see quantum computers
		as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature, and reveal more about 
		this hidden world outside of our experiences.</q>
