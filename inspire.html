	<h1>The Legend of ZUN</h1>

	<p>
		When I was a sophomore in high school, one of my favorite pasttimes was
		simply browsing YouTube for any video I could enjoy. There was an
		abundance of content from all over the world, and at the time I had
		taken a particular interest in content from Japan.
	</p>
	<p>
		During one of these browsing sessions, I came across a popular music
		video titled "Bad Apple". It captivated me with its smooth animation
		and catchy music, but also seemed to have a unique identity to it,
		as though the characters were actually a part of something. A little
		digging in the comments proved my suspicions correct. The characters,
		as well as the music itself, were from a series known as <i>Touhou
		Project</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I soon fell down the rabbit hole, looking up any information I could
		find about the series; what console it was on, when it was released,
		what type of game it was. Shockingly enough, the game hadn't been
		officially released in the west, but had a huge cult following. It
		was a PC game series in the "bullet hell" genre, and it seemed to
		be at the center of a huge fanbase situated all over the world.
	</p>
	<p>
		The one detail that threw me off more than anything, through, was that
		every single part of the games was crafted entirely by one man. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Jun'ya Ota released the first <i>Touhou</i> game in 1996, when he was only 
		19 years old, and would consistently release new titles for decades
		afterward. The most recent game, <i>Violet Detector</i>, came out
		on August 10th, 2018. Ota is the sole member of the doujin circle
		<i>Team Shanghai Alice</i>, and decided to begin developing games
		when he grew bored of the selection available. Since then, dozens
		of other doujin circles have formed to produce music, art, animations,
		and even spin-off games related to the <i>Touhou Project</i> franchise.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ota is most commonly known by his handle <b>ZUN</b>, and continues to produce
		all of the <i>Touhou Project</i> games by himself. I keep emphasizing
		that point, that he makes these games by himself, because it's the
		reason I find him so inspiring. ZUN has crafted a franchise that's made
		its way into a world-wide phenomenon completely by himself. He makes
		games that <i>he</i> enjoys, and is massively successful at it. I've
		considered making games myself, but have always wondered if it were
		a realistic career path or even hobby for me to take on.
	</p>
	<p>
		ZUN's one-man doujin circle is proof to me that your ideas and passions
		can come to life, and the possibilities for them are limitless. I hope
		the work I produce in the future can reach even a fraction of the
		influence <i>Touhou Project</i> has garnered all over the world.
